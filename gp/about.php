                        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Globalpundits is a U.S. based, Minority-Owned Small Business</b> providing engineering and technical consulting services, headquartered in Aiken, South Carolina. Founded in 2000, we support nuclear and mission-critical programs through high-assurance staffing and compliance-aligned program support, operating in environments where regulatory discipline, technical rigor, and execution integrity are fundamental.</p>
                        <h2 class="acc-color" style="font-size:22px;">Program Support & Engagement Model</h2>
<p style="text-align: left; font-size:18px;">Globalpundits supports programs by supplying experienced engineering, technical, and AI-adjacent digital infrastructure professionals who embed directly within prime contractor teams, including programs led by multiple U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Department of Defense (DoD) prime contractors. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; font-size:18px;">Our teams operate in DOE- and DoD-aligned secure program environments, providing cleared and clearance-eligible technical professionals, and Globalpundits maintains certification under the Department of Defense Joint Certification Program (JCP) for compliant handling of controlled technical data. Our role is focused on program support and staff augmentation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; font-size:18px;">Our primary focus is nuclear and regulated energy programs, including advanced and Small Modular Reactor (SMR)–related initiatives, supporting engineering, safety, licensing, quality, and compliance-driven efforts through experienced, program-embedded talent. We also support energy-intensive and infrastructure-aligned digital environments, including AI data centers, by providing engineering and IT professionals experienced in regulated operational settings.</p>                       

 <h2 class="acc-color" style="font-size:22px;">Operating in Regulated Program Environments</h2>    
 <p style="text-align: left; font-size:18px;">We are accustomed to working within strict regulatory and quality frameworks. Our engagement approach emphasizes disciplined execution, alignment with client governance, and respect for established controls and processes.</p>
 <p style="text-align: left; font-size:18px;">Our professionals are deployed with a clear understanding of compliance expectations, documentation rigor, and audit-driven environments, enabling them to contribute effectively within mission-critical programs.</p>
 <p style="text-align: left; font-size:18px;">Globalpundits maintains U.S. government-recognized compliance credentials, including certification under the Department of Defense Joint Certification Program (JCP), aligned with regulated program requirements.</p>

  <h2 class="acc-color" style="font-size:22px;"> Strategic Focus & Outlook</h2> 
  <p style="text-align: left; font-size:18px;">As nuclear and regulated infrastructure programs continue to evolve, Globalpundits is deepening its focus on mission-critical and nuclear-aligned environments, including advanced and emerging reactor initiatives. We are also selectively expanding our international engagement, with active plans to support clients and partners in the Abu Dhabi region as regulatory frameworks, client needs, and program requirements align.</p>
  <p style="text-align: left; font-size:18px;">Our approach to expansion remains deliberate and compliance-driven, prioritizing alignment with local regulations, client governance models, and the expectations of regulated energy and infrastructure programs.</p>
